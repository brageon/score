1. Poker strategy with static priors: 18_Man, 21_Dag. DH.
2. Adobe plugin: 14_Hagal 13_Ehwaz 10_Ansuz 24_Tiwaz. DN DH HC.
3. "Recon-ng": 13_Ehwaz, 23_Sun, 10_Ansuz, 14_Hagal. HC CH CD.
4. "BetterUp": 19_Gebo, 21_Dag, 7_Kenaz, 3_Isa, 11_Raido. HD HC CD NH.

<h2>Writing</h2>

Cadence is anchored by color indices. DH compression is equal in both TA and ES (meta-parameters). ND is highest in both. 

1. Motif: 5g 2Ø 2u 6g 1Ø; 2Ø
2. Chords: DC CD DH CH HN DH CD CH HN CN
3. Melodies: +5+4+3+11+9+3+4+11+9+7+5
