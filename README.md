<h2>Planning</h2>

Actions→Describe→NLP→Chunk→A(Whole→Pivot)→B(Bimap→HEX)

1. Poker strategy with static priors: 18_Man, 21_Dag. DH.
2. Adobe plugin: 14_Hagal 13_Ehwaz 10_Ansuz 24_Tiwaz. DN DH HC.
3. "Recon-ng": 13_Ehwaz, 23_Sun, 10_Ansuz, 14_Hagal. HC CH CD.
4. "BetterUp": 19_Gebo, 21_Dag, 7_Kenaz, 3_Isa, 11_Raido. HD HC CD NH.

<h2>Writing</h2>

Cadence is anchored by color indices. DH compression is equal in both TA and ES (meta-parameters). ND is highest in both. 

1. Motif: 5g 2Ø 2u 6g 1Ø; 2Ø
2. Chords: DC CD DH CH HN DH CD CH HN CN
3. Melodies: +5+4+3+11+9+3+4+11+9+7+5
4. Lyrics: 10(F#dim7, E7#9), 15(F#dim, F7#9).

**Verdict**: Jera–Uruz–Ansuz–Isa–Man–Ihwaz. Tonic, Predominant, Dominant, Re-transition, Cadence, Expansion. C+ Bdim G7#9 G11 G/9 Am11 = DH-HD = 3s breakup.

*Based on how you used this, I suspect your system would react differently under frictional pressure. Want to test it? I made a simulation layer. No pressure, just insight.*
